These areas of swelling are known as micro aneurysms.">

At this point, the body receives signals to start growing new blood vessels in the retina.">

Since these blood vessels are often fragile, thereâ€™s a higher risk of fluid leakage. This triggers different vision problems such as blurriness, reduced field of vision, and even blindness.">

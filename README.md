# Mini-Project
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for preventing vision loss in diabetic patients. In this project, we propose a solution for automated diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning techniques. We preprocess retinal images to enhance features relevant to diabetic retinopathy. Next, we employ transfer learning, leveraging pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as Xception, to extract high-level features from retinal images. These features are then fed into a custom classification model to classify images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we utilize a comprehensive dataset containing a considerable number of retinal images depicting four distinct stages of diabetic retinopathy: mild, moderate,severe, and proliferative. Our system enables early detection of diabetic retinopathy,
facilitating prompt intervention and management to prevent irreversible vision loss in diabetic patients.
